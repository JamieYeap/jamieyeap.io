Jamie's Personal Journey into Data Analysis and Visualization!

I come from a background in engineering, having graduated with a Masters in Engineering (Environmental Engineering) from National University of Singapore. One of the reason why I take a passion in engineering is my passion for analysing data, solving problems and optimising processes. This compliments my strengths of having a keen eye for detail and have always been passionate about planning, analysing and investigation.

As the world started moving towards big data and seeing the importance of data in every sector, I started learning Python with the goal to leverage the vast data analytics library to assist in data analysis. Python is the programming language to learn as it is powerful, fast, plays well with others, runs on any operating system, is friendly & easy to learn. Most importantly, it is an open source.

I have recently embarked on a 100 days of python coding journey with Angela Yu on Udemy Business. There are quizes and projects at the end of every day and I have deposited my codes in my respository here @ https://github.com/JamieYeap/100-days-of-code.
